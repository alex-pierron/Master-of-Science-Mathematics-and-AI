This folder is organized in a way you just have to execute each file to get our results if you want to reproduce them.

The final model is the file Aggregation_Expert.R and this file needs the other to be launched before it if you want to use it without taking our results for the other models. 

"Data_Given" is the folder containing all the data we created and our submission files needed for the expert aggregation.

"Data_User" is a folder for you if you want to use our models and make your own submission with it.

The folder "Data" only contains the train and the test set without any alteration.

The "Report" folder contains our report in both HTML and PDF format. Because of the size of the plots, we exceeded the maximum size of 10 pages. We think that we can not shrink our report less without losing important informations about our methodology and our results.


Warning: Some of the model are time consuming. Gam_Arima_Online.R is the longest to run (around 1 hour minimum with a correct computer).
