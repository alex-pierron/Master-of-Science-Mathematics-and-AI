Repository of our implementation of PixelCNN for binarized MNIST done with Ambre Adjevi-Neglokpe.

You will also find our full report about the two articles we studied.

If you want to launch our application with streamlit, please run the file "application.py" inside the "MNIST" folder by typing the command "streamlit run PATH_TO_FOLDER/application.py" where PATH_TO_FOLDER is your path to the parent folder of application.py. This application allows you to train your own PixelCNN network with multiple choices for parameters.

You can then train it and use it to generate new images based on binarized MNIST. You can also use a pretrained model if you don't have time to train your own model.

Here are the module needed for python if you want to execute our programs: streamlit , numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, torch, torchvision, matplotlib.image
