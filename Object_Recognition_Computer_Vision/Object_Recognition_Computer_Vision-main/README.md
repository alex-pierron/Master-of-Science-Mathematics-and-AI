Final project for the MVA "Object Recognition and Computer Vision" class, 2023-2024.

## Summary

In this work, we build upon the baseline established by [Ventura et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14746) for Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR). 
Our work strives to enhance their results in Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR). Leveraging their insights, we have made straightforward yet promising improvements, particularly in training methodologies and network architecture. 

## Key Contributions

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

1. **Training Enhancements**: We have improved training processes by incorporating contrastive and similar training techniques.
2. **Architecture Upgrade**: We have upgraded the underlying network architecture from [BLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12086) to [BLIP-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12597), resulting in improved performance.
