# Supervised-Learning
This repository gathers our codes and results for the two challenges of the "Supervised Learning" UE of our Master 2 Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence at University Paris-Saclay.
These challenges were carried out in groups by Alex Pierron and Malkiel Riveline.

To be able to run the codes and notebooks, you need to change a few lines of the path to the datasets on your disk in the utils.py file in each challenge folder. Since we can not share the data publicly, we suppose that you have them already at your disposal.
The lines to be changed are indicated at the beginning of each utils.py file, just after the module imports.
You can therefore run the differents notebooks available for each challenge: Data_exploration.ipynb is a notebook only dedicated to explore the given train data and Testing_Models.ipynb is where we try different ML algorithms.

Here's the list of required python libraries:

    - numpy
    - pandas
    - scikit-learn (sklearn)
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    - seaborn
    - os
    - joblib
    - tqdm
    - copy
    - warnings
