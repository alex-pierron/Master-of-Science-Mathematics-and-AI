# Projects from My Master's in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence (2022‚Äì2024)

Welcome to the repository showcasing the projects I undertook during my Master's studies at [Institut de Math√©matiques d'Orsay (IMO)](https://www.math.u-psud.fr) - [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en). These projects span various topics, including pure and applied mathematics, computational methods, and interdisciplinary applications.

## üìö Overview

This repository contains a collection of projects and coursework completed between 2022 and 2024. Each project reflects my exploration of mathematical theories and their real-world applications.

### Highlights of the Projects:

1. **[Online Learning, Optimization and Games]**  
   **Topic**: (Online Learning,Optimization and Game Theory)  
   **Description**: Master II project where we study the problem of solving games using extrapolation and optimism techniques. We first establish some initial theoretical properties and expressions for the subdifferential of the entropic regularizer. We then introduce a new regularizer based on the entropic regularizer and prove that it is a regularizer on the product of simplices. Finally, we analyze the UMP iterates with this new regularizer and derive a guarantee.  

2. **[Object Recognition and Computer Vision]**  
   **Topic**: (Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR), Object Recognition, Computer Vision)  
   **Description**: Final project for the MVA "Object Recognition and Computer Vision" class where we build upon the baseline established by [Ventura et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14746) for Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR). Our work strives to enhance their results in Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR). Leveraging their insights, we have made straightforward yet promising improvements, particularly in training methodologies and network architecture. 

3. **[Supervised Learning]**  
   **Topic**: (Supervised Machine Learning)  
   **Description**: This repository gathers our codes and results for the two challenges of the Master II course "Supervised Learning". These challenges were carried out in groups by Alex Pierron and Malkiel Riveline.
